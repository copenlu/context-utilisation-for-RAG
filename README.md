# context-utilisation-for-RAG

This is the repository for the paper "A Reality Check on Context Utilisation for Retrieval-Augmented Generation" (TBD: add arxiv link).

In the paper, we ground studies of context utilisation to real-world RAG scenarios.

## Dataset
We introduce DRUID (Dataset of Retrieved Unreliable, Insufficient and Difficult-to-understand context) with real-world (query, context) pairs to facilitate studies of context usage and failures in real-world scenarios.

The deveoped DRUID datasets can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/copenlu/druid).
