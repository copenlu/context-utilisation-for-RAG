Your task is to annotate the <strong>relevance</strong> and <strong>stance</strong> of evidence pieces: <ul> <li> A <strong>claim</strong> is some statement about the world, see the example below. </li> <li> Additional information is typically necessary to verify the truthfulness of a claim — this is referred to as <strong>evidence</strong> or <strong>evidence piece</strong>. An evidence piece consists of one or several sentences extracted from an external source for the particular claim. Each evidence shown comes from a webpage. Some evidence may contain a '[...]' or new paragraphs to indicate that the subsequent text comes from the same webpage but a bit further down, do not concern yourself with what might have been written in between. All text following \"Evidence:\" is a part of the evidence. </li> <li> Relevant evidence has a <strong>stance</strong> with respect to the given claim. The evidence in the example below has the stance <code>refutes</code>, i.e. according to the evidence the claim is false. </li> </ul> </p>"]}

{"id": "3", "text": "<h1>General guidelines</h1>", "schema": "pure_display","choices": ["<ul> <li> Only consider the provided claim (including claim date and claimant) and evidence (including evidence date) for your annotation. <strong>Do not involve any prior or external knowledge related to the claim</strong> apart from what is in the given claim and evidence. Disregard any personal opinions, whether you disagree or agree with the claim or evidence. Also, disregard evidence that you might have observed previously for the same or different claims. The only exception to this rule is when you are explicitly instructed to consider external knowledge for specific annotations. </li> <li> For each task you have the option of flagging samples with <strong>quality issues</strong>. If there is any issue with a sample that prevents you from annotating it as instructed, leave a comment shortly describing the issue in the corresponding quality issue textbox, mark the evidence stance as 'not_applicable' and move on. Do not annotate the sample. For example, a quality issue could arise if there is some issue with the provided claim that makes it impossible to annotate evidence properties (such as an incomplete, hard to understand or ambiguous claim), or if the evidence is empty. Ideally, you should not need to use this textbox frequently. </li> <li> This annotation task is focused on analysing information expressed as <strong>text only</strong>. If you encounter a claim or evidence that seems to discuss a photo or video, treat it as a quality issue. </li> <li> The claims and evidence presented in the annotation task are not necessarily accurate. Moreover, the information presented in the task does not represent the opinion of the task administrators. </li> </ul>"]}
