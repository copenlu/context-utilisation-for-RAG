Before you continue, we wanted to share some advice to help make the annotation process as smooth as possible: <ul> <li> You can go back and forth between pages and samples using the buttons at the bottom of the webpage. <strong> Do not use the browser 'back' button to go back to a page </strong> as it will make this webpage behave weirdly. </li> <li> By now, you should have been presented with an introduction page with general guidelines, an instruction page with annotation examples and a page to indicate your consent to participate in this study. If you have missed any of these pages, we recommend that you go back now to make sure that you have seen all necessary pages. </li> <li> We recommend that you <strong> store all instructions to make it easier to go back to them </strong>. This can for example be done by printing the webpage to a PDF file (select 'Print' in your browser and then 'Save as PDF') or taking a screenshot. </li> <li> There are <strong> tooltips </strong> for each answer alternative. When you hover over an alternative with your cursor, more information about that answer alternative will be shown. </li> <li> <strong> Take your time with the annotations. </strong> We understand that the instructions and samples presented may be time-consuming to process. Feel free to go back to the instructions whenever you are uncertain about some sample. We are thankful for your effort and will make sure to adapt the compensation for the annotation work in case it turns out to take more time than initially estimated. </li> </p>"]}
